# PSReadline Utilities
These are code samples (most likely to remain keybindings) for use with PSReadline to make your life easier.

You can use them as a reference for some of the things that are possible with one of the most awesome modules to ever enter the world of PowerShell.

# Notes
- Many thanks to the creator of PSReadline and all contributors. Nothing else has changed my PowerShell experience like you have.
- PSReadline comes with quite a few keybind samples itself. Some of my bindings were inspired by those examples. Check them out yourself - you may well find another gem you like for yourself.
